      <p>
        My love of the outdoors and adventure inspires my art. I spend a lot of
        time hiking, camping, skiing, hunting, fishing, and anything else I can
        do to spend time outside! I love seeing God's hand in the beautiful
        world around me and I want to share it with others through my art. My
        goal is to portray nature and the West in grand and realistic ways. As I
        pursue my career I would like to use my artwork to support conservation,
        wildlife, hunting, and the western lifestyle.
